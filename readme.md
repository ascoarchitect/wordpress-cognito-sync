## Backend Infrastructure

The backend infrastructure is defined using AWS CloudFormation and includes the following components:

* Lambda Function: Handles user and group operations.
* API Gateway: Exposes the Lambda function as a REST API.
* IAM Roles: Provides necessary permissions for the Lambda function.

### CloudFormation Template

The CloudFormation template is located in cognito-sync-cloudformation.yaml. It defines the Lambda function, API Gateway, and IAM roles required for the plugin to communicate with AWS services.

## WordPress Plugin Functionality
### Initialisation
The plugin is initialised in wp-cognito-sync.php. It sets up the autoloading of classes and hooks into WordPress actions.

### Admin Interface
The admin interface is managed by the Admin class. It adds menu items, registers settings, and handles form submissions.

### Tabs

* Settings: Configure API Gateway URL and API key.
* Sync Management: Perform full or test synchronisation of users and groups.
* Logs: View synchronisation logs.
* Group Management: Manage synchronisation of WordPress roles with Cognito groups.

### User Synchronisation
The API class handles communication with the AWS Lambda function. It sends user and group data to the Lambda function for synchronisation with Cognito.

### User Flow

* User logs in to WordPress.
* The User class checks if the user exists in Cognito.
* If not, the user is created in Cognito.
* User data is synchronised with Cognito.

### Group Synchronisation
The plugin synchronises WordPress roles with Cognito groups. The Admin class manages the group synchronisation settings and actions.

### Deployment
#### Prerequisites

* AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions.
* AWS CloudFormation template (infrastructure/cognito-sync-cloudformation.yaml).

#### Steps
* Create two custom attributes in your existing User Pool for storing Wordpress IDs:

Name: wp_user_id
Type: String
Mutable: Yes

Name: wp_username
Type: String
Mutable: Yes

wp_user_id is for storing the user ID reference against the Cognito user record, and wp_username is for supporting usernames which are not email addresses in Wordpress. The Cognito user ID will be stored against the user record in Wordpress to ensure that this is used for quick update matching in the future.

* Deploy the CloudFormation stack:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file infrastructure/cognito-sync-cloudformation.yaml --stack-name wp-cognito-sync --parameter-overrides Environment=prod CognitoUserPoolId=xx-xxxx-x_xxxxxxxx
```

Note the API Gateway endpoint URL and API key from the CloudFormation stack outputs.

### Installation

* Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/wp-cognito-sync directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
* Use the Settings->Cognito Sync screen to configure the plugin with your API Gateway URL and API key.

### Conclusion

The WordPress Cognito Sync plugin provides seamless synchronisation between WordPress and Amazon Cognito User Pools. By leveraging AWS Lambda and API Gateway, it ensures that user and group data is consistently synchronised, providing a robust solution for managing user authentication and authorisation.
